# ✈️ Design Portfolio: CAD and Structural Analysis Projects

Welcome to repository!  
This space showcases some of the structural design and analysis projects I have completed using CAD tools such as Catia or SolidWorks and FEA tools such as Nastran and Ansys, primarily focused on aircraft, drone, or UAV systems.
